    <p><b> Introduction:</b> This is my current homepage for the purpose of future review. 
    My name is Alexis Loriga and I have so far learned only the first half of Calculus 3 
    but my interest of the introduction to 3-dimensional spcae and multivariable functions 
    urged me to make the Calculus 3 section of this webpage.</p>
    
    <p id ="Calculus3"><b>Caclulus 3 Review:</b><br></p>
    <p><b>3-Dimensional Vectors:</b> These are to put simply a short line with a
        magnitude length and direction towards a particular point. It can be referenced
        in multiple dimensions that includes further than 3-D like 4-D but can't be visualized
        beyond 3-D Space. <br><br>
        <b>Three ways to look at vectors:</b> As described by a famous Math youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw">

        <br>According to the video he has said a physics, computer science, and mathmatics student looks at vectors differently.
        Physics students look at them as points in space with a <b>direction and magnitude</b> in a form
        of it pointing towards a point given x and y components. A computer science student usually calls vectors
        another name called <b>Arrays</b> which is basically a set of ordered lists containing 
        data that can be redistributed and changed by adding or taking data away from it.
        A mathematics student looks at it in both ways and in more abstract ways of
        the nature of vectors and how they work.<br><br>
        <b>Vectors:</b> They come in a "n" number of components depending of the dimension.
         A three dimensional vector has three components being X,Y, and Z. They are all in part of a vector
         that is named by a variable with an arrow on top. In 
         engineering/unit vector notation, they are represented respectively as

         </img> and <i style = "font-size:25px;"><br> V = < X, Y, Z ></i>. <br><b>Engineering/Unit Vector Notation:</b> The x component is the symbol i-hat = < 1, 0, 0 > while
         the y component is j-hat = < 0, 1, 0 > and the z component is k-hat = < 0, 0, 1>.<br><br>
         <b>Component Angles:</b> The angle of the x component is alpha while the angle of the y component is
         beta and the z component is gamma.

        <b> Magnitude and Direction:</b> The main ways of describing vectors are magnitude
        which are the length of the vectors and caluclated using the formula ||r||=&radic;(x&sup2; + y&sup2; + z&sup2;). It describes force, speed, and so on.
        Direction can be described by a unit vector and it's scaler which acts as a multiplier or factored
        number from the intial vector. <br><br>
        <b>Dot-Product:</b> It is a scaler that represent a relationship between vectors in several ways and is represent as V*W which each vector having 
        components multiply each other's respective component and adding them together. Firstly, it
        can tell if two 3-D vectors are orthogonal (three dimensional version of perpendicular) then the dot product of those two vectors = 0.
